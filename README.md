# MonarchsFix

How to install

Copy Monarchs fix.hpi to TA:K install path (C:\Cavedog\Kingdoms), then move Kingdoms.key file out from there.

For short, this mod fixes:

1. All monarch's buggy animations after making ghosts, building, walking, turning and building, some would override others and result in a buggy animation (Lokken, for example), you can test that by starting building something then clicking many times into it.
2. In special, Kirenna delays to attack, sometimes you would click and she wouldn't attack.
